This folder contains a small python program that starts a web server
that you can access at through a web browser at
http://localhost:8080. It responds to PUT request to
http://localhost:8080/register (by just printing out the request that
it receives) and shows some content upon GET requests to
http://localhost:8080/dashboard.

It uses the bottle library (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)
to set up the web server.

Usage: 

  > python server_example.py
